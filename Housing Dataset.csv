An expert agent will match properties with your exact search criteria while you search from home.Magnolia Grove is a large, gated complex that was once divided into two separate communities and is now joined together. There are three different exterior styles and colors which can be a bit confusing. The paint colors and schemes are random and do not match from 1 building to the next. The property is predominantly made up of cement parking lots on all sides. Covered and uncovered parking is offered on a 1st come basis. There is very little greenery (a few palm trees) and no courtyards. The pool is centrally located to the property and is nice with outdoor fire pit, small spa and grilling stations. The interiors are average with new carpet, 2in faux wood blinds and nice cabinets. Some units offer black on black appliances and wood vinyl floors but only in upgraded units.

5668630259;housing/rent/apartment;One BR 12261 Fondren Rd;Westbury Reserve is a disappointing apartment complex that is in poor condition and is old. The property is gated, however, gates are left open by people walking in. There are shopping carts on the property from stores that can't be seen nearby. The paint on the doors is chipped and leftover spray paint can be seen around the edges of some of the apartment doors as well. The apartment itself appears old and outdated. The carpet is dingy and the lighting is low. The apartments come with built in bookshelves and washer and dryers located behind 2 double doors off from the dining area. The kitchen has a small bar area but is fairly small with limited counter space. The second bedroom is located next to the front door and the master bedroom is in the back of the apartment making this a suitable layout for roommates or parents with older children. The closet space is small even though the master is walk-in, there is width to it but not much depth.;Gated;1;1;USD;No;Thumbnail;Cats,Dogs;755;$755;Monthly;566;12261 Fondren Road;Houston;TX;29.7714;-95.4343;RentLingo;1577359681,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
